## modExtra

modExtra is a base Extra template that is useful when wanting to create a new
Extra for MODx Revolution. One can git archive from this repository to start
with all the file structure for beginning MODx Extra development pre-setup.

## Informatiom

Note that if you git archive from this repository, you may not need all of its
functionality. This Extra contains files and the setup to do the following:

- Integrates a custom table of "Items"
- A snippet listing Items sorted by name and templated with a chunk
- A custom manager page to manage Items on

If you do not require all of this functionality, simply remove it and change the
appropriate code.

Also, you'll want to change all the references of 'modExtra' to whatever the
name of your component is.
